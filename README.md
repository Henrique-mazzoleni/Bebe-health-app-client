# Bebe Health Tracker

## IronHack Bootcamp module 3 project

### Description

The Bebe Health Tracker was developed by Henrique Mazzoleni and Craig Butler as part of the IronHack Web Development bootcamp.

The tracker can be used by all the people involved in the caring for a young child. It allows carers to track all aspects of a child's routine from feeds and naps to changes and more.

### Link to Deployed App

[Bebe Health App](https://bebe-health.netlify.app/)

## Features

- Log childs feeds, naps and changes
- Add and manage multiple children
- Invite other guardians to a childs record
- Upload an image of child

### Technical Requirements

Develop a full-stack application that must meet the following technical requirements:

- Have a SPA frontend, built with React, consisting of multiple views and implementing all CRUD actions.
- Have a REST API backend built with ExpressJS, MongoDB and Mongoose, that your React app will communicate with.
- Have a REST API backend with routes that perform all CRUD actions for at least one model (excluding the user model).
- Have 3 database models or more. Having one model for users is the first step. The other two (or more) models should represent the main functionality of your app.
- Include sign-up, log-in and log-out functionality with encrypted passwords (or social login) and authorization (logged-in users can do additional things).
- Have two separate repos on GitHub. One repo is for your frontend React application and the other is for your backend REST API.
- Have at least 2 commits per day that you worked on.
- Have a backend validation and centralized error handling in your REST API.
- Be deployed online, allowing anyone to access and use your app.
